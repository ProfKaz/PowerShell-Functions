# PowerShell Learning Approach

During my journey of learning and researching PowerShell, I developed a strategy to streamline my work by breaking everything down into functions. This way, whenever I need to build something—like assembling LEGO pieces—I can simply gather the specific functions I need to achieve my goal. 
All the functions I create are thoroughly tested using PowerShell 7. 
Feel free to use them and share any feedback you have!
