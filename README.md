# PowerShell Learning Approach
<br>
During my journey of learning and researching PowerShell, I developed a strategy to streamline my work by breaking everything down into functions. This way, whenever I need to build something—like assembling LEGO pieces—I can simply gather the specific functions I need to achieve my goal.
<br><br>

All the functions I create are thoroughly tested using PowerShell 7.
