Welcome! My name is Sebastian Zamorano, and I’m a seasoned professional in data governance, cybersecurity, and information protection, with a specific focus on Microsoft Purview and its extensive capabilities. My journey in the tech world has been driven by a passion for empowering organizations to secure their data and enhance compliance through robust governance frameworks and tools.

Over the years, I’ve delved deeply into the realms of Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Microsoft Information Protection (MIP), and the entire suite of Microsoft Purview solutions. Through practical applications and continuous learning, I’ve built expertise in configuring data governance structures, implementing information protection policies, and driving data-centric security initiatives that help teams stay ahead in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

My work is not only about technical configuration but also about creating practical, adaptable training programs that guide organizations on how to use these tools effectively. From foundational topics like setting up Microsoft Purview Data Maps to advanced sessions on cataloging and labeling sensitive data, I am committed to sharing insights that help others harness the power of data governance technology.

In addition to providing strategic insights and hands-on guidance through public webinars and custom training labs, I am also invested in helping teams and individuals grow through initiatives like the Armory initiative. This project inspires people to collaborate, share knowledge, and support each other, fostering a culture of teamwork and learning.

Through my LinkedIn, I actively share updates, insights, and resources related to Microsoft Purview and data protection, keeping my network informed of the latest developments in this dynamic field. You can follow my journey and join the conversation here: [LinkedIn Profile](https://linkedin.com/in/profesorkaz).

In addition to training and consulting, I have developed a range of resources to help others deepen their knowledge and implement practical solutions in data governance and security. Here are a few of the projects and resources I've created:
