Just as there are specialized Lego sets with unique pieces for specific models, this repository includes two categories of PowerShell functions: [Lego](/Lego/HOWTO.md) and [LegoPlus](/LegoPlus/AboutLegoPlus.md). The Lego functions represent versatile, commonly-used components applicable in almost any script, helping streamline repetitive tasks and improve efficiency.

On the other hand, `LegoPlus` functions contain specialized pieces designed for specific scenarios and often require additional services, such as the **Microsoft Graph API**. These functions allow for deeper integration and enhanced functionality by connecting to various Microsoft services, enabling solutions for more complex cases. Additionally, other APIs are available within `LegoPlus`, expanding the range of tasks these functions can accomplish.

This repository provides a robust toolkit(I'll be working to growth this part), making it easy to build both standard and advanced PowerShell scripts to meet a wide range of needs.
