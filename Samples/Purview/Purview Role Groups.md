# Create a Microsoft Purview Role Group

Microsoft Purview enables you to work using the principle of least privilege. This means you can create "Role Groups," which are subgroups of roles designed for specific activities.

The following PowerShell script creates a Microsoft Purview Role Group. The groupâ€™s name is defined at the beginning of the script in the **ScriptVariables** section.

This approach is particularly useful when you have multiple automated scripts that require a limited set of permissions, as it automatically assigns only the specific permissions needed.

To verify that you have access to the correct cmdlets, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-Command -Module tmp* | ft Name, CommandType -AutoSize
```

This command will provide insights into the available commands and the information accessible with the roles assigned to the new role group.

```powershell
# Script to Create Role Groups.
# You need to execute this script manually with enough permissions to create role groups, Compliance Administrator role is recommended.

{
	[string]$script:RoleGroupName = "My custom role group"
